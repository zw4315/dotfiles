# Docs Index

This repository keeps a small set of actively maintained docs.

## Core Docs

- `docs/SETUP.md`: installation, upgrade, and recovery steps
- `docs/NVIM.md`: Neovim usage, keymap, and workflows
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`: medium-term direction and milestones
- `docs/BACKLOG.md`: task pool with priorities
- `docs/notes.md`: personal notes (not normalized)

## Maintenance Rules

- Keep keymap documentation only in `docs/NVIM.md`.
- Keep installation documentation only in `docs/SETUP.md`.
- Use Git history for change logs; do not create per-change summary docs.
- Move outdated deep-dive docs to archive only when needed.
