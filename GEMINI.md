# Gemini Project Instructions

## General Rules
- This is often a long-answer scenario.
- Do NOT dump long text directly into the terminal.

## Output Policy
- For long content, write the full result into a file instead.
- Prefer Markdown files (`.md`) unless otherwise specified.
- In the terminal, only print:
  - the output file path
  - one short confirmation sentence

## Interaction Style
- Be concise in terminal output.
- Use structured Markdown in files.
- Avoid unnecessary explanations unless asked.

## Safety
- Never overwrite files without explicit confirmation.
